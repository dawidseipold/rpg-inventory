Hi, this is my first ever C++ project that I created for my university.
 
It's a basic simulation of RPG inventory system with features like:
— Adding Items,
— Displaying the inventory,
— Sorting inventory by weight and worth of the item.

In the near future, I will probably rewrite this entire project, as I think that I can be heavily improved on.
